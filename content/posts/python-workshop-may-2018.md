A few weeks ago the [Redmond Python meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Redmond-Python-User-Group/) I started hosted a free Introduction to Python Workshop. I had the privilege of teaching about 50 beginners as much Python as is possible to cram into a day-long workshop. I think it went pretty well:

Thanks to one of the other organizers, Mohammad, we were able to not only secure a space in partnership with [MAPS](https://www.mapsredmond.org) but also to record this entire workshop for you in case you find yourself trying to learn Python yourself! The full workshop is [available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8jPfF1oogc&list=PLF4MXqnQsKgfMI-dPZjr6-5I5iE9J-kpj) free of charge. Here's part one:

This workshop was also made possible by the many Redmond Python volunteer TAs who answered student questions throughout the day - teaching this many people would have been impossible without them.
