I've just released a new course on [Linux Academy](https://www.linuxacademy.com). It's called Fullstack Serverless Applications on AWS. 

I think this will be a great course for anyone wanting to learn more about serverless application development on AWS and a great way to add a new project to your portfolio too!

You can read more about the course in the official annoucement on the [Linux Academy blog](https://linuxacademy.com/blog/amazon-web-services-2/announcing-fullstack-serverless-applications-on-aws/).
