FIX DATE BEFORE PUBLISH

I had the good fortune of going to AWS re:Invent this year for the first time and have a few takeaways from the event I'd like to share.

First and foremost, I suggest that if you run into Jeff Barr while wearing a penguin suit be sure to say hello... ![Fernando with Jeff Barr](/images/reinvent_2017/fernando-medina-corey-jeff-barr.png) 

<h3>Advice for First-time Atendees</h3>

This was my first year at re:Invent and I learned a few things the hard way so I'm hoping you can avoid my mistakes. Here's a few tips.

**Plan Out Your Sessions ASAP**
Use whatever scheduling tool AWS offers for the event early on and have a plan for your preffered sessions, backup sessions and everything else you'd like to do for the week. Schedule time on your calendar to actually reserve your seat *the minute* that the registration goes live or you probably wont get much of what you want. Sessions fill up fast!

But if the worst happens you can try walking up to less popular sessions for open seats. Many of the sessions will end up online for you to watch later on.

Plan out your sessions
Sign up for sessions immediately when the registration opens 
Don’t worry too much about sessions/ they’ll end up online anyway?

Fully portable Phone charger 
Phone battery low image

Fully charged laptop to take notes (no outlets in sessions or few of them)

Chapstick - dry hotel air

Don’t try to get between sessions quickly it won’t happen.
Shuttle can take 45 min depending on venue even in the same building you’ll need to get in line early for some sessions 
Start one - pick a building each day and go to everything you can there 
Strat two - pick a few good sessions 

Walking shoes

Water 

jacket - cold at night 

In the expo hall? Gel inserts standing so long
