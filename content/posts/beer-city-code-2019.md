What a great few days at [Beer City Code](https://beercitycode.com/)! My first time in Michigan was a blast and I'm thrilled I was invited to teach Python this year.

For anyone who wasn't able to come out to the conference, I try to make my curriculum available publicly so you can learn Python on your own schedule - [**here**](https://fernando-mc.github.io/python3-workshop/).

I had the good fortune of attending several amazing talks including an excellent talk on integrating Raspberry Pi sensors with Azure's IoT services from [Alexander Slotte](https://twitter.com/alexslotte). He did a great job of explaining how to stream Raspberry Pi sensor data into Azure and trigger actions based off the sensor data.

I also can't wait to integrate some of the presentation style ideas from the "Choose Your Own Adventure" style talk given by [Joel Lord](https://twitter.com/joel__lord) that I unfortunately missed.

And of course, I have to mention the incredible keynote from the hilarious [Chloe Condon](https://twitter.com/ChloeCondon)! As another recovering theatre kid, I hope to include nearly as many puns in my next talks as she did.

Thanks for a great conference Beer City Code organizers and attendees and hopefully I'll be back again next year!
