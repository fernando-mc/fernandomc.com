Hello Folks,

I know I've been quiet recently and I want to reach back out and tell you about what I've been up to and give you some special subscriber benefits as a thank you for keeping tabs on me and my work.

For starters, today I'm launching [Moonrise Labs](https://www.moonriselabs.com/)!

<!--more-->

Moonrise Labs is a new technology education platform that I built to meet the needs of hands-on learning that I wish I'd had when starting my tech career. The [first three courses]((https://www.moonriselabs.com/courses)) are out already and two are completely free for anyone to take. If you like the content after you sign up, I'm also giving all of you 50% off a monthly subscription with the code FMC50OFF as a thank you for all your support these past years.

Also coming up soon I will be launching [The Serverless Cookbook](https://theserverlesscookbook.com/) - A book filled with everything you need to know to get up and running with real-world serverless applications fast. For any subscribers who are interested I am giving out 5 advance draft copies *for free* to any subscribers who agree to read it over within a month and give me edits and feedback.

To keep tabs on these projects you can sign up for the [Moonrise Labs mailing list](https://signup.moonriselabs.com/join) or the [The Serverless Cookbook mailing list](https://theserverlesscookbook.com/). I'll be keeping them separate to try and spare your inboxes if you're not interested. That way this blog will still be focused on the free tutorials and guides I've focused on over the years.

Thanks for your support! Feel free to email me or and [join the Moonrise Labs discord](https://discord.gg/qeyfuvymMZ) if you want to say hi or ask any questions!

\- Fernando
