Twilio just published my article on building SMS notification applications with JavaScript and the Serverless Framework. Here's a teaser:

"Who loves dogs? I do! So much that I wanted to build a spam-resistent text notification website using the Serverless Framework on AWS, Twilio, Google Recaptcha, and Node.js (just so I could make you look at my puppy photos). Building this project should be free or only cost a few pennies.  When you’re ready, let’s walkthrough how to build your own Serverless application and integrate it with multiple APIs to enrich the functionality."

You can read the rest on Twilio's blog [here](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/09/serverless-text-notification-app-serverless-javascript.html).
