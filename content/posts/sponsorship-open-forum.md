I'd like to start accepting sponsorship to this blog soon and I'd like your feedback. I think that accepting sponsorship will allow me to commit more to creating free educational content for everyone. If done correctly, I think it can be a win-win for everyone. But I want to make sure that you feel that way too.

## What will it look like?

For right now, you can expect sponsorship to look like the banner you see above. A simple plain pitch with a link to learn more about the product. No flashing, scrolling, or multi-colored text or obnoxious ad boxes.

I will also **always** let you know upfront if I have any sponsorship arrangement with a product I am writing about.

## Who will and wont be sponsoring?

You can expect to only see products that I personally use or think are useful and good products. Most likely, this means development tools and services that might be relevant to folks building their own projects.

  I will always turn down requests from:

  - Products or companies I don't think people reading this blog would be interested in
  - Anyone with a shady reputations

  I'll also be careful to listen to readers with concerns about anyone I do end up partnering with.

## Give your feedback

With all this said, I'd like to hear from you if you have:

- Suggestions on how to ensure the integrity of the blog in this process
- Any concerns you'd like addressed moving forward

Please [contact me](/contact/) directly or leave a comment below with your thoughts!
