I have some exciting news: I'm writing a book on serverless development!

<!--more-->

After years of working with serverless technologies I've decided to write a book. I think Serverless development is the fastest and easiest way to develop new applications and I'm writing the book to show how it's done!

If you want to know as soon as The Serverless Cookbook is published then please **[sign up for updates](http://theserverlesscookbook.com/)**!

By signing up, you'll know as soon as the book is available for sale and get access to free preview chapters, demos, and videos.

You can also keep an eye on the blog here for more updates for all you folks who've already been reading my posts for so long.

Cheers!
Fernando
