I have a new three-hour long course on building serverless applications from the perspective of a frontend developer. Some of the things you'll learn include:

- How to deploy serverless frontends on AWS with SSL, a custom domain, and the CloudFront CDN
- How to spin up your first backend APIs with the Serverless Framework
- How to integrate Auth0 into your frontend
- How to use Auth0 to secure your backend APIs

The best part? **It's 100% free!** Feel free to check it out [here](https://serverless.com/learn/courses/serverless-for-frontend-developers/). Let me know what you think [on Twitter]({{% my_twitter %}})!
