I just published a new Pluralsight course! If you want to learn more about DevOps tools and AWS then check it out: [Continuous Delivery and Automation on AWS for DevOps Engineers](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/continuous-delivery-automation-aws-devops-engineers)! Remember, you can get access to Pluralsight for free [on me](https://pluralsight.pxf.io/mA1DD)!

The title is a mouthful, I know, but the course will take you through a **ton** of great information on different AWS DevOps services. Let's look at some of what I'll cover in the course!

<!--more-->

At a high level You'll learn about...

### 1. Using AWS CodeCommit for Git-based version control:

![Visualization of a git workflow involving forks](/images/devops-aws-course-2020/git-forking.png)

Where I'll cover everything from concepts like remotes and branches, different Git workflows and basic commands you need to work with Git from the CLI.

You'll also work directly with Git to make sure you're feeling comfortable before digging into all the other concepts!

### 2. Leveraging AWS CloudFormation to manage infrastructure as code:

![Visualization of CloudFormation templates creating a stack of resources](/images/devops-aws-course-2020/cloudformation-template.png)

Where you'll deploy AWS cloud resources using JSON and YAML templates that describe the infrastructure you're deploying before deploying those resources using the AWS CLI and AWS Console.

### 3. Testing (and building) your code with AWS CodeBuild:

![Visualization of CodeBuild environments](/images/devops-aws-course-2020/codebuild.png)

You'll integrate tests with a Python Flask project run those tests inside of a CodeBuild environment:

You'll even use this later on to automate a build pipeline!

### 4. Complex Blue/green deployments with AWS CodeDeploy:

And how you can integrate them with different application infrastructure including EC2, ECS, AWS Lambda, or on-premises servers.

### 5. And how you can put all this together in automated CI/CD pipelines with AWS CodePipeline!

We'll start by covering some of the basic concepts around CodePipeline:

![Visualization AWS CodePipeline pipeline](/images/devops-aws-course-2020/codepipeline.png)

And then we'll create an entire CI/CD process all the way from `git push`, to testing code in AWS CodeBuild, deploying it using AWS CodePipeline, and seeing those changes reflected live in our application!

## Don't forget the demos!

Throughout the course, you'll work through a bunch of demos on the topics above **and more!** They will give you hands-on experience working with all these services using both the AWS CLI and the AWS Console. And you'll have all the code samples you need to reference later in your own projects!

If you have any questions about the course, don't hesitate to reach out I'd love to hear from you!
