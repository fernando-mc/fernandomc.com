I recently published an article in The New Stack on migrating AWS SAM applications to the Serverless Framework. <!--more-->

**Disclosure: While I have used the Serverless Framework for years, as of this posting I've recently taken a job with Serverless Inc. (the makers of the framework) as a Solutions Architect.**
