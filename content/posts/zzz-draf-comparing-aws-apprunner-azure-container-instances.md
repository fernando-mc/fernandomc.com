AWS recently launched AWS AppRunner and I [tried it out for the first time](). I also recently used [Azure Container Instances for the first time](). So now that I've used both I wanted to take a closer look at how they differ and compare functionality and pricing.



## Some Context

So why do I care so much about Azure Container Instances and AppRunner? When working on the sandbox environment portion of [Moonrise Labs](https://app.moonriselabs.com/) I needed a way to offer real-world development environment sandboxes without requiring learners to install a ton of their own software or fix their own development environments. Azure Container Instances enabled that for us in the first iteration of Moonrise Labs but there were some challenges that I was curious of AppRunner would be mature enough to solve.

Admittedly, I am most likely using these services in an unintended way. The containers created are short-lived and low-traffic environments that are very frequently created and destroyed and the scale required is not horizontal within a container but in the number of individual unique container-domain name associations possible. This means that I don't have a good reference to test the intended production use case - real scalable containerized services that require flexible amounts of RAM/CPU.

# Core Features

- Lowest Settings: [AWS == 1 vCPU, 2GB] vs. Azure???
- Where do the images come from? Azure: ECR/ECR Public
- Azure Azure COntainer Repository/DockerHub??? 
- Azure NO HTTPS WTF??!? VS. AWS and HTTPS -- Default
- AWS Unique - Use Source Code OR containers (ACI just had container)
- Custom Domain
- Where does the container come from (private/public)
- Container scaling (automatic vs. manual vs. thresholds)
- Alerting
- Language and OS support
- Ports and domains (Azure Container Instances missing port mapping)
- Quirks and missing features (Custom domains? review)

## The Bottom Line - A Price Comparison

- How pricing works for both
- Different pricing numbers
- What Amazon Wants to do --> Get you to scale up when needed and be happy you're paying more?
- Azure the same? Or diff?

## Development Complexity and Intuitiveness

- Azure has three fucking entities

Because neither of them came close to the simplicity of Azure Container instances I chose to integrate Azure Container Instances in
