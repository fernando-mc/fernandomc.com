It's time for my annual review! Starting last year, I began to review what I've managed to accomplish over the course of the previous 365 days.

Here's a summary of 2018 by the numbers:

- Published 14 blog posts on this blog
- Launched the [Upfront blog](https://blog.upfrontjobs.io/) and wrote 7 blog posts for it
- Read [37 Books](/reading-list)
- Published over 50 hours of video content in several [new courses](https://www.fernandomc.com/publications/) 
- Gave 8 technical talks, workshops or in-person tutorials which you can [review here](https://www.fernandomc.com/workshops/). 
- Earned 6 [AWS Certifications](http://linkedin.com/in/fmc-sea)
- Grew [Redmond Python](https://www.meetup.com/Redmond-Python-User-Group/) to over 550 members
- Grew the [Serverless Finch plugin](https://github.com/fernando-mc/serverless-finch/) to over 15k monthly downloads
- Made the most [embarrassing attempt](https://github.com/fernando-mc/vue-game) at a frontend project ever

Overall I think it was a great year and I met my goals of creating some of the best cloud training content in existence.

This year I'll be working on a few different projects including:

- Making a variety of new courses for Pluralsight.com
- Launching and growing [Upfront Jobs](http://upfrontjobs.io/)
- Taking on a few cloud consulting clients

And of course, I'll still occasionally be writing occasional guides on AWS technology so stay tuned for that too.
