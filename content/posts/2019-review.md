2019 was a year. In usual fashion I've decided to post a review of some of the things you may or may not have seen from me that I finished up along the way.

In the first half of 2019 I quit my my job to work for myself for a while!

**Upfront Jobs and Techpayrates**

Creating [Techpayrtates.com](http://techpayrates.com/) and collaborating on [Upfront Jobs](https://blog.upfrontjobs.io/) helped me try my hand at product design, frontend development, and integrating additional tools like Algolia and Stripe into my applications. I worked on every element of the technical stack and contributed articles to Upfront Jobs about what makes good, supportive, and diverse workplaces.

**Stormlight Consulting**

After launching [Stormlight Consulting](http://stormlightconsulting.com/), I worked with clients who needed help working with particular AWS services, wanted projects built out, or were curious about optimizing cost on AWS.

**Pluralsight Courses**

I also spent a good part of the year publishing three new Pluralsight courses on [optimizing cost on AWS](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/aws-architecting-cost/table-of-contents), using [Amazon Translate](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/aws-translate-text/table-of-contents), and working with the suite of [AWS IoT services](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/aws-iot-big-picture/table-of-contents).

**Serverless Inc.**

Towards the end of the year I took an offer to work with [Serverless Inc.](http://serverless.com/) - A company I've been excited about since the first day I started using the Serverless Framework back in 2016! So far at Serverless, I've:

- Published a series of free online tutorials on [Serverless for Frontend Developers](https://serverless.com/learn/courses/serverless-for-frontend-developers/) (which you should check out!)
- Given a variety of technical talks at conferences ranging from [LibertyJS](https://www.fernandomc.com/posts/creating-serverless-applications-for-your-portfolio/) in Philadelphia, PA to [LISA19](https://www.fernandomc.com/posts/creating-serverless-applications-for-your-portfolio/) in my home state of Portland, Oregon
- Blogged, presented, tweeted, coded and otherwise had a blast in working on serverless projects

You can expect more tutorials, demos, and content from me in 2020 so [sign up for my mailing list](/mailing-list) to keep informed of everything I'm up to. If you'd like to give me suggestions, always feel free to let me know [on Twitter]({{% my_twitter %}})!

Have a great 2020 everyone!
