Hello! I'm hosting a free talk on Wednesday Oct. 7 at 11am about connecting IoT Devices to the cloud! If you're interested you can sign up on Meetup.com [here](https://www.meetup.com/Redmond-Python-User-Group/events/273440026/).

<!--more-->

In the talk I'll cover everything from authenticating devices with the cloud to setting up sensors on a Raspberry Pi! I hope to see you there! 

If you're checking this post after the event, don't worry! [Here's a guide of mine](https://witekio.com/connect-raspberry-pi-aws-iot/) on how to get started with a Raspberry Pi!

I'll also try to update this with the event recording afterwards!
