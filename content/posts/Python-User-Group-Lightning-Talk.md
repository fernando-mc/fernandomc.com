Thanks to all the great folks who came over to Wharton tonight for the Python User Group. I had a great time presenting and then learning about PySpark from Monetate.

Some folks wanted the slides to my talk so I've included them [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B__8CIDfTsIEWldmZGJseERYRjg/view?usp=sharing).

You're also welcome to checkout the code I used on [Github](https://github.com/fernando-mc/EasyDice). You can also see the [live project](https://rawgit.com/fernando-mc/EasyDice/master/index.html) (hosted by github).

PRs welcome!

Lastly, some of you were curious about other 'formulas' for password creation. Well if you have one you think is better (either easier to remember and AS secure, or as easy-to-remember and MORE secure) let me know! You can read more about ones I've looked at [here](https://fernandomc.com/posts/good-bad-ugly-theoretical-security-password-creation-systems/)

Thanks again for joining me at the PUG!
