I have a webinar coming up November 19th at 10AM PT that you're welcome to attend for free - [sign up here](https://witekio.com/webinarcloud/)! 

In the webinar, I'll be covering the essential concepts and tools needed to connect IoT devices to the cloud securely including device authentication and authorization to how you can integrate your IoT Devices with some cloud services. 

I'll also showcase a live demo of a Raspberry Pi and PIR sensor that I integrated with AWS to make sure I know if my dog is trying to eat my lunch!
