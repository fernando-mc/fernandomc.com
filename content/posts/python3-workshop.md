Thanks again to everyone who came out to the Redmond Python Introduction to Python 3 Workshop this year! 

<!--more-->

We had a newer curriculum and enough room for the massive crowd that turned out!

For anyone interested, the curiculum will be hosted for free [here](https://fernando-mc.github.io/python3-workshop/) but it may change shape or move around in the future so stay tuned.
