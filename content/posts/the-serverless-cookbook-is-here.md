Back in 2021 I started writing [The Serverless Cookbook](https://fernandomc.com/posts/writing-the-serverless-cookbook/). I am thrilled to say that I have finished the first edition of the book and it is [now available here](https://www.theserverlesscookbook.com/)!

<!--more-->

This book contains all of the different projects and examples that I wanted when I started working with serverless technologies. The ones that would jump start my fledgling business ideas into real, read-to-go applications.

I think serverless development remains one of the fastest ways to develop scalable, feature-rich applications. But it is a challenge to know what techniques and architectures to apply to which situations. That's why this book gives you all the context and code you need to dive right in.

Not only does this book have a written component with all the projects and example code for integrating core AWS services with your serverless applications, the full book contains video tutorials of virtually every example.

This way you can see step by step exactly what I'm doing to deploy and test my applications.

If you're interested in the book, please take a look at the [website](https://www.theserverlesscookbook.com/) and let me know what you think! And to everyone and anyone who patiently waited for this book to come out, thank you so much for your support - it turns out while scaling up serverless is fast, writing a book about it is not!
