I'm excited to announce that I have not one but TWO new Pluralsight courses! Both [Collecting Data on AWS](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/collecting-data-aws) and [Storing Data on AWS](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/storing-data-aws) are now available on Pluralsight! 

<!--more-->

In [Collecting Data on AWS](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/collecting-data-aws) I'll show you how to use AWS Services like Amazon Kinesis Data Streams and Kinesis Firehose along with other technologies that will help you get your data into AWS.

In the [Storing Data on AWS](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/storing-data-aws) course, I'll show you how to use tools like DynamoDB, Amazon S3, and other tools for storing data inside of AWS.

Both of these courses will help prepare you for the AWS Certified Data Analytics Specialty certification exam - But alone they're not enough! Definitely check out all the other courses that Pluralsight offers that these two are a part of before you take the exam.
