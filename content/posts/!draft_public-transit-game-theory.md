Chazz doesn't care about public transportation at all. He just wants to know if he should bother to pay for his ticket from a perspective of purely rational self-interest.

Because of this Chazz asks me a few basic questions.

1. How frequently do I see ticket enforcement? 
2. What's the penalty for getting caught riding the train without a ticket?

He also tables the discussion of timing and location that ticket enforcement targets because we happen to ride the same stops consistently. 

The answer to the first question is simple:

INCLUDE IMAGE OF ALL MY PASSES HERE

Because I've kept every pass I've ever purchased I know I've ridden the train to and from work exactly 37 times since I moved to Seattle. 

I also know that over the course of all those rides I've been checked by ticket enforcement exactly three times.

Because
