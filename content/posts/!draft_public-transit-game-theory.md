When I moved back to the Seattle area from Philadelphia I started riding a prominent Seattle commuter train several times a week. After the first few weeks of commutting I was surprised by how infrequently I saw Seattle ticket enforcement officers. I've always paid my fare (and plan to continue doing so because trains are awesome and I support public transit), but I started to wonder, if I were a perfectly rational decision maker and didn't care about public transit would I still pay?

Let's imagine we have a morally ambivalent person who is taking the same route as I do and rides the same train. Let's call him Chazz. Chazz doesn't care about public transportation at all. He just wants to know if he should bother to pay for his ticket from the perspective of the potential consequences.

Because of this Chazz asks a few basic questions.

1. How frequently does ticket enforcement appear? 
2. What is the penalty for getting caught riding the train without a ticket?

He also makes the assumption that the timing and locations that ticket enforcement appears should be roughly equivalent to my experience. 

The answer to the first question is simple:

INCLUDE IMAGE OF ALL MY PASSES HERE

Because I've kept every pass I've ever purchased I know I've ridden the train to and from work exactly 37 times while I was still commuting via train. 

I also know that over the course of all those rides I've been checked by ticket enforcement exactly three times. Two of those times were outside the normal hours of a work commute.

With this highly scientific sampling I know there's about an 8% chance of being pulled aside by ticket enforcement


I've since moved somewhere else within the greater Seattle area and left Chazz to fend for himself. From having to ride the bus into town occasionally I've also re-realized that trains are by far the better form of transit. The one thing I will admit is that buses are much better at fare collection. Here's hoping that some day the US or at least large municipalities will invest enough into public transit to eliminate the need to charge for it.
