I ride a prominent Seattle commuter train several times a week almost the entire length of the route. I get on at the first stop and get off at the second to last. I started doing this when I moved to Seattle and was surprised by how infrequently I saw Seattle ticket enforcement officers. Now I pay my daily toll every ride and plan to continue doing so because trains are awesome and I support public transit. 

But I started to wonder, if I were a perfectly rational decision maker and didn't care about public transit would I still pay?

Let's imagine someone in the office next door just started and will be taking the same route as I do and rides the same train. Let's call him Chazz. Chazz doesn't care about public transportation at all. He just wants to know if he should bother to pay for his ticket from a perspective of purely rationale self-interest.

Chazz asks me a series of questions

Exactly three times in x rides
