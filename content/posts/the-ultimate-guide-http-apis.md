In addition to my [recent guide](https://serverless.com/blog/serverless-auth-with-aws-http-apis/) on using auth with the new AWS HTTP APIs and the Serverless Framework. I've started a more comprehensive guide the using AWS HTTP APIs.<!--more-->

You can keep an eye on it [here](https://serverless.com/aws-http-apis) as I make additions and changes over the next few weeks.

*Disclosure: While I have used the Serverless Framework for years, as of this posting I am employed by Serverless Inc. (the makers of the Serverless Framework).*
