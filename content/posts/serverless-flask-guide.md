I just created a free [new guide](https://serverless.com/flask/) to using Flask and Python to create a text-message greetings API with AWS Lambda and SNS. <!--more-->

You'll learn how to deploy a Flask application in AWS Lambda with the Serverless Framework, how to restructure your application as you add additional code, and how to optimize your function package and application. Check it out [here](https://serverless.com/flask/) Want to see more added to the guide? Just leave your requests below.

*Disclosure: While I have used the Serverless Framework for years, as of this posting I am employed by Serverless Inc. (the makers of the Serverless Framework).*
