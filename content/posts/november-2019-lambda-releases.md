AWS recently annouced a bunch of new features for Lambda. You can read my summary and analysis of the new features on the Serverless Blog [here](https://serverless.com/blog/november-2019-lambda-releases/) in my post on the [Serverless Blog](https://serverless.com/blog).

*Disclosure: While I have used the Serverless Framework for years, as of this posting I am employed by Serverless Inc. (the makers of the Serverless Framework).*
