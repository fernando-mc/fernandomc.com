I'm happy to annouce my newest course, the [AWS Certified Developer - Associate Level](https://linuxacademy.com/amazon-web-services/training/course/name/aws-certified-developer-associate-2018) certification prep course.

This course is by far the largest one I've ever done and has a LOT of content. There are over 14 hours of videos, as well as a variety of labs, flashcards, and quizzes. 

Here's a sneak peak of what you can expect inside one of my favorite labs:
