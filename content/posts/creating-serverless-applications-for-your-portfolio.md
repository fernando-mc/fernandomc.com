After an exhausting week and a half traveling to conferences I'm back home in Seattle and have my talk and workshop content from the trip to share with you! If you're interested in getting started with Serverless on AWS and learning how to add serverless applications to your development portfolio you should take a look!
<!--more-->

First, I spent a week in Philly for two conferences, at [LibertyJS](https://libertyjs.com/) I gave a talk on Creating a Serverless Development Portfolio in Seven Days or Less. You can [Watch the Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUVPXETRQDc&feature=youtu.be&t=42), take a look at [the slides](https://speakerdeck.com/fernandomc/making-a-serverless-development-portfolio-in-seven-days-or-less) or peruse [the code](https://github.com/fernando-mc/libertyjs-jams) I used for the presentation.

I also traveled to Portland for the [LISA19](https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa19) conference put on by [USENIX](https://www.usenix.org/). At that event I gate a workshop on Creating your First Serverless Application on AWS. You're welcome to take a look at [the guide](https://fernando-mc.github.io/creating-first-serverless-app-aws/), [the slides](https://speakerdeck.com/fernandomc/creating-your-first-serverless-application-on-aws) or [the code](https://github.com/fernando-mc/serverlessjams).

Have any questions about these talks? Give me a shout in the comments below or [on Twitter]({{% my_twitter %}})!
