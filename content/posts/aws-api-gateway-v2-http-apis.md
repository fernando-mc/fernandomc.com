During AWS re:Invent this year AWS announced a new way to make HTTP APIs with API Gateway v2. It now includes things like native support for JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) and a vastly simplified number of AWS resources to get an API up and running. You can read about all the updates [here](https://serverless.com/blog/api-gateway-v2-http-apis/) in my post on the [Serverless Blog](https://serverless.com/blog).
