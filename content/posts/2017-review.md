2017 is now over and I want to take a moment to think about how it went for me. This year I:

- Left my Data Engineering role to make courses full time
- Published [3 courses](/publications/)
- Started [serverlessfoo.com](https://www.serverlessfoo.com/) to showcase fun beginner projects using serverless technologies
- Read [28 books](/reading-list/)
- Wrote 21 blog posts here on fernandomc.com
- Wrote [2 external articles](/publications/) 

<!--more-->

In 2018 my main goals are to focus on new ways I can help others learn. I think this will include:

1. Publishing more new courses
2. Creating more open source sample projects and
3. Writing more blog posts on my own site and for other publications 

And I want your help! If you have a moment, I'd like to hear what technologies and topics you're interested in this year! Leave a comment, or [contact me](/contact) to let me know what you want to read about, build, and learn this year!
