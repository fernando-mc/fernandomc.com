2017 is now over and I want to take a moment to think about how it went for me. This year I:

- Left my Data Engineering role to make courses full time
- Published [3 courses](/publications/)
- Started serverlessfoo.com to showcase fun beginner projects using serverless technologies
- Read [28 books](/reading-list/)
- Wrote 21 blog posts here on fernandomc.com
- Wrote [2 external articles](/publications/) 

<!--more-->

In 2018 I'm hoping to create more courses, make more open source sample projects to help folks learn to use new technologies and write for more publications and I could use your help! If you have a moment, I'd really like to hear what technologies and topics you're interested in this year! Leave a comment, or [contact me](/contact).
