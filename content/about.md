I'm Fernando Medina Corey and here are a few things you might want to know about me.

### Software

While I currently focus on technologies from public cloud providers like Amazon Web Services, I've worked with a variety of different technologies in order to develop web applications, manage data pipelines, and architect cloud infrastructure. For more details about my professional experiences you can always look at my [LinkedIn]({{% my_linkedin %}}) or [GitHub](https://github.com/fernando-mc) profiles. 

I currently spend my days making courses to help software engineers, architects, and technology professionals learn the technologies they need to succeed. You can check out my courses [here](/publications).

### Meetups

I founded and run the [Redmond Python](https://www.meetup.com/Redmond-Python-User-Group/) meetup. The over 500 members do things like:

- Teach free full-day Introduction to Python workshops
- Host regular project nights to answer Python questions
- Schedule presentations on Python-related topics ranging from Flask to TensorFlow 

I previously organized the [Serverless Philly](https://www.meetup.com/ServerlessPHL/) meetup which hosted talks by the creators of two serverless frameworks (Zappa and Shep), grew the membership to over three hundred, and saw regular attendance at our workshops and events.

I also taught and TAed classes on Python and the Command Line for Python User Group and Girl Develop It.
