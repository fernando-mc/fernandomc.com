I'm Fernando Medina Corey - a data engineer and technical course author. Here are a few things you might want to know about me.


## Technical Courses

I spend my days making courses to help software engineers, architects, and technology professionals learn the technologies they need to succeed. You can check out my courses here:

- [AWS Certified Developer - Associate Level](https://linuxacademy.com/amazon-web-services/training/course/name/aws-certified-developer-associate-2018)

If you're currently taking one of my courses and have feedback or questions, feel free to [contact me]({{% contact_page %}})!

## Meetups

I founded and run the [Redmond Python](https://www.meetup.com/Redmond-Python-User-Group/) meetup. The over 250 members do things like:
- Teach free full-day Introduction to Python workshops
- Host regular project nights to answer Python questions
- Schedule presentations on Python-related topics ranging from Flask to TensorFlow 

When I lived in Philadelphia I also organized the [Serverless Philly](https://www.meetup.com/ServerlessPHL/) meetup which hosted talks by the creators of two serverless frameworks (Zappa and Shep), grew the membership to over three hundred, and saw regular attendance at our workshops and events.

I also taught and TAed classes on Python and the Command Line for Python User Group and Girl Develop It.

## Data Engineering

As a data engineer at [Curalate](https://www.curalate.com) I helped centralize terabytes of company data across the entire organization to power reporting for business and product teams. For more details about my professional experiences you can always look at my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fmc-sea/). I've also maintained an interest in collecting and distributing interesting datasets in useful ways and most of my development projects have a data aspect to them, including many of my serverless [example projects](https://www.serverlessfoo.com/).
